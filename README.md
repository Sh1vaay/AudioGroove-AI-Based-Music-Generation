Project Title: AI-Powered Music Creation

Abstract
The field of Generative AI has experienced significant growth in recent years due to advancements in deep learning and artificial intelligence. This project utilizes cutting-edge AI models like LSTM and DCGAN's GAN, as well as different music representations such as MelSpectrograms and Piano Rolls, to transform music composition. The aim is to break free from traditional constraints in music creation, allowing for the rapid and coherent generation of multitrack compositions spanning various genres. The project envisions a future where AI and human creativity collaborate seamlessly, blending technological innovation with artistic expression. Through an intuitive interface, musicians and enthusiasts can interact in real-time with AI-generated music, fostering a harmonious blend of technical skill and creative flair.

Introduction
Traditional music creation often faces challenges like high costs, time limitations, and limited genre exploration. This project seeks to revolutionize music production by enabling quick, coherent, and diverse multitrack generation using LSTM and GAN. It explores the fusion of art and technology in music generation, where LSTM and GAN redefine music composition, production, and creativity, pushing the boundaries of what is achievable.

Methodology
The project comprises the following key stages:

Data Collection and Preprocessing: Compiling a varied dataset of musical compositions and preparing them for training the AI models.
Model Training: Training LSTM and GAN models on the preprocessed dataset, experimenting with different architectures and hyperparameters to achieve optimal results.
Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the trained models using various metrics and comparing them to compositions created by humans.
