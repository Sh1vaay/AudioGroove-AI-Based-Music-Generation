**Project Title: AI-Powered Music Creation**

**Abstract:**
The field of Generative AI has witnessed significant growth in recent years owing to advancements in deep learning and artificial intelligence. This project employs state-of-the-art AI models like LSTM and DCGAN's GAN, alongside various music representations such as MelSpectrograms and Piano Rolls, to revolutionize music composition. The goal is to eliminate traditional constraints in music creation, enabling the swift and coherent generation of multitrack compositions across diverse genres. The project envisions a future where AI and human creativity seamlessly collaborate, fostering a dynamic interplay between technological innovation and artistic expression. Through an intuitive interface, musicians and enthusiasts can engage in real-time interaction with AI-generated music, sparking a harmonious fusion of technical expertise and creative ingenuity.

**Introduction:**
Traditional music creation often encounters challenges like high costs, time constraints, and limited genre exploration. This project aims to transform music production by facilitating fast, coherent, and diverse multitrack generation using LSTM and GAN. It explores the convergence of art and technology in music generation, where LSTM and GAN redefine music composition, production, and creativity, pushing the boundaries of what is achievable.

**Methodology:**
The project is structured into the following key components:

- **Data Collection and Preprocessing:** Gathering a diverse dataset of musical compositions and preprocessing them for training the AI models.
- **Model Training:** Training LSTM and GAN models on the preprocessed dataset, experimenting with various architectures and hyperparameters to achieve optimal performance.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluating the performance of the trained models using different metrics and comparing them to compositions generated by humans.
